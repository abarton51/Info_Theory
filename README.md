# Cross Entropy as a Loss Function for Classification Tasks

This short paper on information theory from the ground up covers:
- Entropy, Conditional Entropy, Mutual Entropy
- Mutual information
- KD Divergence/Relative Entropy
- Cross Entropy
- Interpretation and significance
- Use in machine learning classification tasks

## Math 4280

In addition to my paper information thory for classification, I provide a directory of solutions and notes from a course in Information Theory found at `./math4280`
