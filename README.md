# An Overview of Information Theory for Classification Tasks in Machine Learning

This paper from the ground up covers:
- Entropy
- Mutual information
- KD Divergence/Relative Entropy
- Cross Entropy
- Statistical significance
- Use in machine learning classification tasks

## Math 4280

In addition to my paper information thory for classification, I provide a directory of solutions and notes from a course in Information Theory found at `./math4280`
